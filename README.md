<h2> 💬 About me: </h2>

I am a high school student (currently a junior) making this github account on my occurence for doing my job shadow. I have autism and I am a gifted student. I play video games (Call of Duty, Battlefield, Fortnite, GTA 5, and others.) I workout 2-3 times a week with my father and brother. I am trying to graduate and go to college for Computer Engineering.
